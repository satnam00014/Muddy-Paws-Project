# Muddy-Paws-Project

Problems we had faced :
So we have made github repositories to co-ordinate our project but we were facing many problems 
so each group member have work on there respective task and then we send our work to satnam to merge and to commit on git hub the whole project as one.
We have done regular google meetings to co-ordinate our project and explain our logic and code so it will be easy to merge our work as one.
Due to complex ui design some member using vmware faced problem in pulling from git hub and issue in implementing so we thing to co-ordinate through meetings.
All team members were using different system which also increased our problems like intel same system, M1 and vmware.
Second when we pot intit with terminal have intel system working normal, 
after init need to open podfile to type 'GooglLogIn' , 'FBSDKlogin' and 'Firebase/Core' , 'Firebase/Auth' 
than install pods from terminal working well with intel and VMwareï€ but when we are trying to do with M1 it was giving us error
