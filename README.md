# Muddy-Paws-Project
Defining and analyzing the problem

Our muddy paw app has focused on many problems of users. As most of the people love to keep dogs and cats at their home however most of them have works like 
they have their business work and jobs therefore they must go to the other towns, cities, and countries for different purpose. 
Eventually, they must drop their idea of keeping pets because they think who will take care of their dogs if they will no longer be at their home. 
Besides this, some dogs and cats have special and different habits of eating, sleeping, and walking. Furthermore, some dogs and cats are old and pregnant who needs
special care. Additionally, pet owners find it difficult to leave their dogs under someone care with full of interest because they want to see their dogs or cats’ 
images and they videos of their pets. Moving further, if users find few apps available in the market, then they face interface and design issues because most of 
the apps are complicated to use. Users want to schedule their dates and time according to them and they want solution for it. Furthermore, dogs and cats need 
vaccination timely, and users find it difficult to take their pets in the clinic because of their busy schedule. 
Last one Mehmet and Satnam utilized the M1 system MacBook, which resulted in flaws in the UI design they made using the Gurinder intel operating system MacBook, 
resulting in pod issues.

Problems we had faced :
•	So we have made github repositories to co-ordinate our project but we were facing many problems so each group member have work on there respective task and then we send our work to satnam to merge and to commit on git hub the whole project as one.
•	We have done regular google meetings to co-ordinate our project and explain our logic and code so it will be easy to merge our work as one.
•	Due to complex ui design some member using vmware faced problem in pulling from git hub and issue in implementing so we thing to co-ordinate through meetings.
•	All team members were using different system which also increased our problems like intel same system, M1 and vmware.
•	Second when we pot intit with terminal have intel system working normal, after init need to open podfile to type 'GooglLogIn' , 'FBSDKlogin' and 'Firebase/Core' , 'Firebase/Auth' than install pods from terminal working well with intel and VMwarebut when we are trying to do with M1 it was giving us error
